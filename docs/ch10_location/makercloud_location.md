# Exploring the Location Based Features of MakerCloud

[TOC]

Using MakerCloud's location features, users can record and monitor the locations of their topics, and view their topic locations and data through an automatically created map in MakerCloud.

### Recording Topic Location

- Go to a project in MakerCloud, and enter the IoT homepage. Scroll down to the map.
- There you can update the topic by navigating around the map and clicking where you want your topic to be virtually located.

###### If you complete these steps with more than one topic on the same project, you can view all of their locations.
- Go to the "Chart" Tab in your Project. You will be able to see the topics, as well as any data that those topics receive.
- For example, you can see smart lamppost data when it is being published.
